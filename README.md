How does this spreadsheet benefit Pacific Net & Twine?
- This spreadsheet is used multiple times a week to identify wich products on the website need to have their prices updated.
- This spreadsheet identifies which items are missing images or weights so that our website manager can make the appropriate changes.
- It compares our two databases to find items on our website that we have no inventory for, or items that we have inventory of, but don't have on the web.
